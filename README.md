## Basic examples

### 1. Single card

You can render a single card by typing either it's full name:

**💡 Example :** `sol ring`

or part of it's full name if there's no ambiguity:

**💡 Example :** `wrath god`

### 2. Single card of a specific set

If you want to render a card from a specific set, you can prefix the name with the set code:

**💡 Example :** `mps sol ring` (will render Sol Ring from the _Kaladesh Inventions_ set)

### 3. Specific card from a specific set

Some sets contain cards with different illustrations. If you want a specific card, you can specify the set code and the collector number:

**💡 Example :** `und forest` (will render the basic Forest from the _Unsanctioned_ set, collector number 95)

**💡 Example :** `und 96` (will render the full art Forest from the _Unsanctioned_ set, collector number 96)

### 4. Random cards

The bot can also rander random cards. To do that, you still have to guide it through the kind of card you are looking for.

**💡 Example :** `🤴` (will render a random legendary creature)

**💡 Example :** `🤴 🧟` (will render a random legendary creature)
